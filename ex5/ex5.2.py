Exercise 5.2.
Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such
that:

a**n + b**n = c**n

for any values of n greater than 2.

1.  Write  a  function  named check_fermat that  takes  four  parameters —
    a, b, c and n — and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. If n is greater
    than 2 and

        a**n + b**n = c**n

    the program should print, “Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!”. Otherwise the
    program should print, “No, that doesn’t work.”

2.  Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a, b, c and n,
    converts them to integers, and uses check_fermat to check whether they
    violate Fermat’s theorem.
