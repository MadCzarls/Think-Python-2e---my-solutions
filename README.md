<font size = 35> THINK PYTHON </font>

This repo is for think python 2e problems at the end of each chapter.

Thanks to github.com/MadCzarls for setting up the initial repopsitory. I have been using his but saw that pull requests havent been merged in years and that the repo hasn't been modified in five years.

As I work through this book for a class that I am in I will update the repository.

Feel free to fork the repo for your own use or to changeor add any problems that I have missed.
