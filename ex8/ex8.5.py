Exercise 8.5.
A Caesar cypher is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter
by a fixed number of places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the
alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary, so ’A’ rotated by 3 is ’D’
and ’Z’ rotated by 1 is ’A’. To rotate a word, rotate each letter by the same amount.
For example, “cheer” rotated by 7 is “jolly” and “melon” rotated by -10 is “cubed”.
In the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship computer is called HAL, which is
IBM rotated by -1.

Write a function called rotate_word that takes a string and an integer as parameters,
and returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string rotated
by the given amount.

You might want to use the built-in function ord, which converts a character to
a numeric code, and chr, which converts numeric codes to characters. Letters of
the alphabet are encoded in alphabetical order, so for example:

>>> ord('c') - ord('a')
2

Because 'c' is the two-eth letter of the alphabet.

But beware: the numeric codes for upper case letters are different.

Potentially offensive jokes on the Internet are sometimes encoded in ROT13,
which is a Caesar cypher with rotation 13. If you are not easily offended,
find and decode some of them.
